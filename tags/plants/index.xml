      <description>Understanding the traits mediating species&amp;rsquo; responses to climate change is a cornerstone for predicting future community composition and ecosystem function.
Although species&amp;rsquo; eco-physiological properties determine their response to environmental change, most trait-based studies focus on a small subset of easily measured morphological traits as proxies for physiology. This choice may limit our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on species&amp;rsquo; demography, and obscure the underlying mechanisms.
We conducted a transplantation experiment along a 1000-m elevation gradient in the Alps to quantify the degree to which changes in plant abundance due to climate warming were predicted by eco-physiological performance versus common morphological traits.</description>
