      <description>As climate changes, species&amp;rsquo; ability to spatially track suitable climate depends on their capacity to spread (or migrate), a function of their population growth and dispersal capacity. Migration lags can ameliorate the climate experienced at species&amp;rsquo; expanding range edges as conditions become increasingly similar to those of the range core. When this boosts species&amp;rsquo; growth rates, migrations accelerate.
As part of my Ph.D. work, I used simulations of a spreading population with an annual life history to explore the consequences of variation in demography across climatic gradients for the dynamics of climate induced range shifts.</description>
