      <title>Eco-physiological and morphological traits explain alpine plant species&#39; response to warming</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/ecophysio/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the traits mediating species&amp;rsquo; responses to climate change is a cornerstone for predicting future community composition and ecosystem function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although species&amp;rsquo; eco-physiological properties determine their response to environmental change, most trait-based studies focus on a small subset of easily measured morphological traits as proxies for physiology. This choice may limit our ability to predict the impacts of climate change on species&amp;rsquo; demography, and obscure the underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We conducted a transplantation experiment along a 1000-m elevation gradient in the Alps to quantify the degree to which changes in plant abundance due to climate warming were predicted by eco-physiological performance versus common morphological traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Physiological measurements revealed that warming favored species with a conservative leaf-level water use strategy whereas species whose leaf-level water use was more â€˜wastefulâ€™ were more likely to suffer from the warmer and drier climate. Nevertheless, the predictive power of physiological traits did not exceed that of morphological traits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our results, therefore, show that while easily measured morphological traits can successfully predict plant abundance responses to climate, eco-physiological approaches are needed to understand the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ecological lags govern the pace and outcome of plant community responses to 21st century climate change</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Forecasting the trajectories of species assemblages in response to ongoing climate change requires quantifying the time lags in the demographic and ecological processes through which climate impacts species&amp;rsquo; abundances. Since experimental climate manipulations are typically abrupt, the observed species responses may not match their responses to gradual climate change. We addressed this problem by transplanting alpine grassland turfs to lower elevations, recording species&amp;rsquo; demographic responses to climate and competition, and using these data to parameterise community dynamics models forced by scenarios of gradual climate change. We found that shifts in community structure following an abrupt climate manipulation were not simply accelerated versions of shifts expected under gradual warming, as the former missed the transient rise of species benefiting from moderate warming. Time lags in demography and species interactions controlled the pace and trajectory of changing species&amp;rsquo; abundances under simulated 21st-century climate change, and thereby prevented immediate diversity loss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lowland plant arrival in alpine ecosystems facilitates a decrease in soil carbon content under experimental climate warming</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/lowland-soilcarbon/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate warming is releasing carbon from soils around the world, constituting a positive climate feedback. Warming is also causing species to expand their ranges into new ecosystems. Yet, in most ecosystems, whether range expanding species will amplify or buffer expected soil carbon loss is unknown. Here, we used two whole-community transplant experiments and a follow-up glasshouse experiment to determine whether the establishment of herbaceous lowland plants in alpine ecosystems influences soil carbon content under warming. We found that warming (transplantation to low elevation) led to a negligible decrease in alpine soil carbon content, but its effects became significant and 52% ± 31% (mean ± 95% confidence intervals) larger after lowland plants were introduced at low density into the ecosystem. We present evidence that decreases in soil carbon content likely occurred via lowland plants increasing rates of root exudation, soil microbial respiration, and CO2 release under warming. Our findings suggest that warming-induced range expansions of herbaceous plants have the potential to alter climate feedbacks from this system, and that plant range expansions among herbaceous communities may be an overlooked mediator of warming effects on carbon dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Dispersal Evolution and Local Adaptation Affect the Range Dynamics of Species Lagging Behind Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/spread-waves/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/spread-waves/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As climate changes, species? ability to spatially track suitable climate depends on their spread velocity, a function of their population growth and dispersal capacity. When climate changes faster than species can spread, the climate experienced at species? expanding range edges may ameliorate as conditions become increasingly similar to those of the range core. When this boosts species? growth rates, their spread accelerates. Here, we use simulations of a spreading population with an annual life history to explore how climatic amelioration interacts with dispersal evolution and local adaptation to determine the dynamics of spread. We found that depending on the timing of dispersal evolution, spread velocity can show contrasting trajectories, sometimes transiently exceeding the climate velocity before decelerating. Climatic amelioration can also accelerate the spread of populations composed of genotypes best adapted to local climatic conditions, but the exact dynamics depends on the pattern of climatic adaptation. We conclude that failing to account for demographic variation across climatic gradients can lead to erroneous conclusions about species? capacity to spatially track suitable climate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Phenological plasticity is a poor predictor of subalpine plant population performance following experimental climate change</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/phenodyn/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/phenodyn/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Phenological shifts, changes in the seasonal timing of life cycle events, are among the best documented responses of species to climate change. However, the consequences of these phenological shifts for population dynamics remain unclear. Population growth could be enhanced if species that advance their phenology benefit from longer growing seasons and gain a pre?emptive advantage in resource competition. However, it might also be reduced if phenological advances increase exposure to stresses, such as herbivores and, in colder climates, harsh abiotic conditions early in the growing season. We exposed subalpine grasslands to ~3 K of warming by transplanting intact turfs from 2000 m to 1400 m elevation in the eastern Swiss Alps, with turfs transplanted within the 2000 m site acting as a control. In the first growing season after transplantation, we recorded species&amp;rsquo; flowering phenology at both elevations. We also measured species&amp;rsquo; cover change for three consecutive years as a measure of plant performance. We used models to estimate species&amp;rsquo; phenological plasticity (the response of flowering time to the change in climate) and analysed its relationship with cover changes following climate change. The phenological plasticity of the 18 species in our study varied widely but was unrelated to their changes in cover. Moreover, early- and late-flowering species did not differ in their cover response to warming, nor in the relationship between cover changes and phenological plasticity. These results were replicated in a similar transplant experiment within the same subalpine community, established one year earlier and using larger turfs. We discuss the various ecological processes that can be affected by phenological shifts, and argue why the population-level consequences of these shifts are likely to be species- and context-specific. Our results highlight the importance of testing assumptions about how warming-induced changes in phenotypic traits, like phenology, impact population dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Community Dynamics in Warmer Mountains</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/project/warmer-mountains/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Many of the most dramatic biological impacts of climate change are mediated by species interactions. Still, we largely ignore how climate change influences the way species interact, and how this affects community dynamics. Due to their steep climatic and ecologic gradients, mountains are excellent systems to study how species interactions will influence community dynamics in future climates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of my doctoral research, in collaboration with &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.landecology.ethz.ch/the-group/people/loic-pellissier.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Loic Pellisier&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://alexanderecology.weebly.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Jake Alexander&lt;/a&gt;, we transplanted pieces of alpine meadow to lower elevations in the Swiss Alps to investigate how climate change alters the performance of different species and the nature of the interactions among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;strong&gt;combined the field experiment with mathematical models&lt;/strong&gt; of metacommunity dynamics to investigate the timescales of the arrival and impact of low elevation species relative to the changes driven by changing interactions among alpine species.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;field-experiment&#34;&gt;Field experiment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We moved alpine turfs to lower elevations in a mountain slope in the eastern Swiss Alps to impose increasing degrees of climate warming, similar to what these plant communities will experience in the following 100 years of climate change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is a Swiss News report about the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- blank line --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-collection-and-modelling-approach&#34;&gt;Data collection and modelling approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every summer from 2017 to 2020, we mapped the position and canopy cover of all the plants in the turfs. By comparing maps from one year to the next, we estimated key demographic rates for each species as a function of climate and the density of neighboring plants. With these estimated parameters, we built a model to project community dynamics over the next century under different climate change scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Landscape-scale effects of geomorphological heterogeneity on variability of oak forest structure and composition in a monogenetic volcanic field</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/tepoz-ped/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 31 May 2017 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/tepoz-ped/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Background: Eruptive events in monogenetic volcanic fields create mosaics of lava fields that result in different successional times and stages, and environmental conditions. Such geomorphological heterogeneity may be related to patterns of vegetation structure, diversity, and composition across a landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aims: To examine landscape-scale effects of geomorphological heterogeneity on the spatial variability of oak forest structure and composition in a monogenetic volcanic field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Methods: We sampled oak forests in six geomorphological units within a monogenetic volcanic field in El Tepozteco National Park and carried out redundancy analyses to relate environmental variables to forest composition and structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results: Geomorphological heterogeneity explained 28.8 and 25.7 % of the variation in canopy structure and composition, respectively, and 21.6% of the variation in understorey composition. Exposed rock was the most important predictor of understorey composition and canopy structure, while elevation was a better predictor of canopy composition. The role of chronic human disturbance as a driver of forest composition and structure was minor compared to that of geomorphological heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The geomorphological heterogeneity created by volcanic activity in this landscape drives oak forest variability; however, considerable unexplained variation in vegetation traits remains, which could be associated with unmeasured dimensions of environmental heterogeneity, neutral processes, and the effects of long-term human activity in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Google Earth Surface Metrics to Predict Plant Species Richness in a Complex Landscape</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/tepoz-remotesensing/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Google Earth provides a freely available, global mosaic of high-resolution imagery from different sensors that has become popular in environmental and ecological studies. However, such imagery lacks the near-infrared band often used in studying vegetation, thus its potential for estimating vegetation properties remains unclear. In this study, we assess the potential of Google Earth imagery to describe and predict vegetation attributes. Further, we compare it to the potential of SPOT imagery, which has additional spectral information. We measured basal area, vegetation height, crown cover, density of individuals, and species richness in 60 plots in the oak forests of a complex volcanic landscape in central Mexico. We modelled each vegetation attribute as a function of surface metrics derived from Google Earth and SPOT images, and selected the best-supported linear models from each source. Total species richness was the best-described and predicted variable: the best Google Earth-based model explained nearly as much variation in species richness as its SPOT counterpart ($R^2$ = 0.44 and 0.51, respectively). However, Google Earth metrics emerged as poor predictors of all remaining vegetation attributes, whilst SPOT metrics showed potential for predicting vegetation height. We conclude that Google Earth imagery can be used to estimate species richness in complex landscapes. As it is freely available, Google Earth can broaden the use of remote sensing by researchers and managers in low-income tropical countries where most biodiversity hotspots are found.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fossil hunting with statistical models</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/project/fossils/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Fossils are exceptionally valuable for our understanding of the history of life. They are also extremely rare and difficult to find. For my M.Sc. thesis, I combined climate-envelope, taphonomy, and discovery models to identify potential fossil areas of Late Pleistocene Australian megafauna.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The idea is that for a place to have fossils of a given species, the species must have lived there before dying and becoming fossilized. Thus, by modeling the potential distribution of the species based on paleoclimate and fossil presence data, we can get a first idea of where to look for its fossils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But within the distribution of a species, only a few organisms will be fossilized, and only a few fossils will ever be found. By modeling the probability of fossil preservation and discovery as a function of environmental variables, and combining the predictions with those of the climate-envelope model, we can detect the best areas to look for fossils of the species of interest.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where to dig for fossils: Combining climate-envelope, taphonomy and discovery models</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/fossil-hunting/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/fossil-hunting/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fossils represent invaluable data to reconstruct the past history of life, yet fossil-rich sites are often rare and difficult to find. The traditional fossil-hunting approach focuses on small areas and has not yet taken advantage of modelling techniques commonly used in ecology to account for an organism?s past distributions. We propose a new method to assist finding fossils at continental scales based on modelling the past distribution of species, the geological suitability of fossil preservation and the likelihood of fossil discovery in the field, and apply it to several genera of Australian megafauna that went extinct in the Late Quaternary. Our models predicted higher fossil potentials for independent sites than for randomly selected locations (mean Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic = 0.66). We demonstrate the utility of accounting for the distribution history of fossil taxa when trying to find the most suitable areas to look for fossils. For some genera, the probability of finding fossils based on simple climate-envelope models was higher than the probability based on models incorporating current conditions associated with fossil preservation and discovery as predictors. However, combining the outputs from climate-envelope, preservation, and discovery models resulted in the most accurate predictions of potential fossil sites at a continental scale. We proposed potential areas to discover new fossils of Diprotodon, Zygomaturus, Protemnodon, Thylacoleo, and Genyornis, and provide guidelines on how to apply our approach to assist fossil hunting in other continents and geological settings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Structure and diversity of oak forests in El Tepozteco National Park (Morelos, Mexico)</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/tepoz-oakforests/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blockecology.github.io/publication/tepoz-oakforests/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Quercus (oak) is among the most speciose and widespread genera occurring in Mexico; paradoxically, the ecological knowledge about Mexican oak forests is meager. Here we describe the floristic composition, diversity, and structure of the terrestrial component of the oak forests of El Tepozteco National Park (TNP), Central Mexico, and relate their floristic and structural heterogeneity to the geomorphological complexity of the park. We randomly distributed sixty 100-$m^2$ plots among six geomorphological units: the lava fields of the Chichinautzin, Suchiooc, Otates (upper and lower) and Oclayuca volcanoes, and the El Tepozteco Range. Vegetation structure and diversity were described by geomorphological unit and for the oak forest as a whole for canopy (DBH $\geq$ 2.5 cm) and understory plants. We report 324 vascular plant species recorded in the plots, plus 17 species collected outside the plots (a total of 341 species, 208 genera and 88 families). The family with more species was Asteraceae (57) and the most speciose genus was Salvia (10). Geomorphological units differed in mean species richness per plot (2.0-33.5 species), absolute richness (60-149 species), and species? structural contributions. Structural differences were also observed, but they were not always significant. Quercus rugosa was dominant in Chichinautzin, Suchiooc, and upper Otates; Styrax ramirezii in lower Otates and Oclayuca, and Quercus castanea and Q. obtusata shared dominance in El Tepozteco Range (the unit with the largest overall richness and oak species diversity). The structure and composition of TNP oak forests are highly variable, apparently due to the region&amp;rsquo;s complex geological past. This heterogeneity should guide the conservation and restoration of these forests.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2022 EPI weighting explorer</title>
      <link>https://blockecology.github.io/apps/epi22-weight-explorer/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://blockecology.github.io/apps/epi22-weight-explorer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The 2022 Environmental Performance Index is composed of 40 indicators measuring different aspect of environmental sustainability, including trends in greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, waste management, air quality, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deciding how much each indicator counts towards the overall EPI score involves some subjectivity, and some have criticized the weighting scheme in the 2022 EPI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EPI website has a tool to modify the relative weights of environmental issue categories and policy objectives, but not the weight of individual indicators. Thus, it is not possible to explore how the EPI would change if, for example, the indicator measuring GHG emissions per person had a larger weight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I created this interactive tool to address this limitation. Now you can choose your own weights for every EPI indicator and see how the scores and ranks of countries change as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
